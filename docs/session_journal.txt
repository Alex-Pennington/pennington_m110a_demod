M75 Walsh Debug and Project Summary

Continued M75 Walsh decode debugging with extensive parameter search:
- Symbol offsets: 0-20000 (no match)
- Scrambler offsets: 0-160 (no match)  
- Gray mappings: 8 variations (no match)
- Bit inversions: tested (no match)

Loopback continues to work perfectly - real file decode remains blocked.

Created comprehensive project documentation:
- docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md - Full project status
- docs/TODO.md - TODO tracker with all items

Project Status Summary:
- 21/21 main tests passing
- 20/22 modes fully working (M150-M4800)
- 2/22 modes partial (M75NS/NL loopback only)
- All equalizers working (DFE, MLSE L=2/L=3)
- All channel models working (AWGN, Watterson)

M75 paused pending further investigation of:
1. sync_75_mask adaptive weighting
2. 4800 Hz vs 2400 Hz symbol timing
3. MES/MNS block synchronization
