# API - Public Interface

## Purpose

This folder contains the public API for the M110A modem. These headers and implementations define how external code interacts with the modem.

## Critical Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `modem.h` | Main modem interface |
| `modem_tx.h/cpp` | Transmit API |
| `modem_rx.h/cpp` | Receive API |
| `modem_types.h` | Type definitions |
| `modem_config.h` | Configuration structures |
| `version.h` | Auto-generated by build.ps1 - DO NOT EDIT |

## Rules

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Changes to these files affect all consumers. Do not break existing function signatures without discussion.

2. **version.h is AUTO-GENERATED**: Never edit `version.h` directly. It is generated by `build.ps1` on every build.

3. **Documentation**: All public functions must have doxygen-style comments.

4. **Include Guards**: All headers must use `#ifndef` include guards.

## Dependencies

These files are used by:
- `server/` - TCP server wrapper
- `test/` - Test GUI
- External consumers of the modem library
